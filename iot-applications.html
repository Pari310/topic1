    <h2>Activity Summary </h2>
    <h3>Activity 1: Think about IoT applications</h3>
        <p>
            Through this activity, we learn about IoT applications. It explains what an 
            IoT application is and provides IoT application examples. Also,the common characteristics of 
            these IoT applications. The activity was discussed as a part of group. 
            Various points were bring into light during the discussion and different ways in which we can 
            define the IoT application was seen.   
        </p>
    <h3>Activity 2: For the scenario of a smart building</h3>
        <p> 
            In this activity, we addressed what it meant to be "smart" in the context of a smart 
            building. We also looked at the numerous components and features that the building needs in
            order to operate effectively.We also looked forward to where this system would be beneficial for us. 
        </p>
    <h3>Activity 3: Think about the control interface required for a smart building IoT application</h3>
        <p>
            Within this activity, we discussed the operation of the smart building system and the components
            that would come together to form it. The activity centres on the control interface and considers 
            who the system's users are.
